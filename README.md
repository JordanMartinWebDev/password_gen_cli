# Password Generator CLI
Created to make local password management more secure by requiring a hash for access to your encrypted passwords.

## How to run
For Linux:
Access the dist folder in the repo. Download the "main" file. Run the main file. 
```./main```
The program will automatically make any files needed in the directory where the executable is. (advised to make a folder for this program to live)
